Absolutely! Based on the repo name `messiy` and assuming it's a project you're developing (possibly related to messaging or user interaction — please correct me if it’s something else), here's a **professional and adaptable `README.md`** template that you can paste directly into your GitHub repository:

# ⚡ Messiy

**Messiy** is a lightweight, extensible platform for building real-time messaging and interaction features. Built with scalability and developer experience in mind, it can serve as a foundation for chat apps, comment systems, or collaborative tools.

This code builds a hybrid NER system for Korean text that:

Uses rules and dictionaries for high-precision extraction of common patterns

Falls back to a trained deep learning model for general entity recognition

Useful in chatbots, document tagging, information extraction, and more
